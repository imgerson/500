# Music

Since I hate repetition I programmed this script to read the
"Rolling Stone's definitive list of the 500 greatest albums of all time"
you can find here:
http://www.rollingstone.com/music/lists/500-greatest-albums-of-all-time-20120531

This script will output a random line of the 500 album list and append it to a
"listened" file. Continue this until you have listened the complete list, if you like.


"""python
# Music is love.
"""

Just clone the repository and give execution permission to "go.py" and go.
